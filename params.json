{"name":"PyDeployToolkit","body":"Welcome to use [PyDeployToolkit](https://github.com/fyears/PyDeployToolkit), a python apps deployment toolkit.\r\n\r\nIt's not quite easy to deploy python apps for freshmen in production. This toolkit would help.\r\n\r\n**But remember, you are at your own risk if you decide to use this toolkit. The author @fyears is NOT responsible to your choice.** Well, the author are trying the best to avoid bugs, since he or she is using it as well. :-)\r\n\r\n**Now, this toolkit is for ubuntu only! Though you may use it in other system if you make some changes.**\r\n\r\n[Nginx](http://nginx.org/en/) and [uWSGI](http://projects.unbit.it/uwsgi/wiki) are perfect to deploy python apps.\r\n\r\nTo install them using this toolkit (you must be a root user or using `sudo`) when you are in the toolkit folder: \r\n`git clone git@github.com:fyears/PyDeployToolkit.git`  \r\n`cd PyDeployToolkit/`   \r\n`sh install_nginx.sh`   \r\n`sh install_uwsgi.sh`  \r\nYou must install nginx before uWSGI.\r\n\r\nWhen you want to add a virtualhost (you must be a root user or using `sudo`):  \r\n`sh /root/vhost4py.sh`  \r\n\r\nThe toolkit will do the following things:  \r\n* Install nginx and add the init file  \r\n* Install uWSGI and add the init file  \r\n* Simplify the steps to add a new virtualhost  \r\n\r\nWith the help of the toolkit, :  \r\n* You can configure the nginx conf file(s) you want in `/usr/local/nginx/conf`  \r\n* You can configure the uWSGI params with files, if you put all your uwsgi files in `/home/pyconf/uwsgiconf/`. (`uwsgi --emperor /home/pyconf/uwsgiconf --emperor-tyrant` will run on system boot.)  If you use socket, you should always set `uid = www` and `gid = www`, and it's strongly recommended to run (for example) `sudo chown www:www yourdomainconf.ini` after you modify the file.  \r\n* Every `/home/wwwroot/$domain/pyenv` folder created by `./vhost4py.sh` is a python virtualenv.  \r\n* You can easily upgrade nginx with `./upgrade_nginx.sh`.  \r\n* You can easily upgrade uWSGI because it's installd by running `sudo pip install uwsgi`.\r\n\r\nYou should know:  \r\n* web dir: `/home/wwwroot`  \r\n* to manage nginx: `/etc/init.d/nginx {start|stop|reload|restart|kill}`  \r\n* to manage uwsgi: `{start|stop|reload|restart|kill} uwsgi_emperor`  \r\n* to check nginx file: `/usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx -t`  \r\n* Every time you change the uwsgi conf files (`/home/pyconf/uwsgiconf/*.{ini|xml|json|...}`), the related python apps should be reloaded automatically.  \r\n* Every time you change the nginx conf files or python project files, you have to reload or restart nginx and uwsgi_emperor by hands.  \r\n\r\nThis toolkit is compatible with and modified from another amazing toolkit: [LNMP](http://lnmp.org). In fact, you can just run `./install_uwsgi.sh` after installing that toolkit. After that your VPS or your server can run both python apps and php apps. You can add a vhost running in php with `cd /root && sudo ./vhost.sh`. Many files in this toolkit are directly taken from [LNMP package](http://soft.vpser.net/lnmp/lnmp0.8.tar.gz), some are modifed, and some are created by @fyears with the help of Internet.\r\n\r\n\r\nWebsites you may be interested in:  \r\n* [Nginx](http://nginx.org/en/)  \r\n* [uWSGI](http://projects.unbit.it/uwsgi/wiki)  \r\n* [LNMP](http://lnmp.org)  \r\n* [PyDeployToolkit](https://github.com/fyears/PyDeployToolkit)  \r\n\r\nTo find the author of this python apps deployment toolkit:  \r\n* [Fleeting Years // 流年](http://www.fyears.org/)  \r\n* [@fyears](http://twitter.com/fyears)  \r\n\r\n\"Fork it\" and \"send pull request\" are warmly welcome.","tagline":"A toolkit to help you deploy python apps with nginx and uWSGI.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
